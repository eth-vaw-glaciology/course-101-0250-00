    "Based on the experience you acquired solving the [Exercise 1](#exercise_1_-_car_travel) we can now consider a car moving within a 2-dimensional space. The car still travels at speed $V=113$ km/h, but now in North-East or North-West direction. The West-East and South-North directions being the $x$ and $y$ axis, respectively. The car's displacement in the West-East directions is limited to $L=200$ km. The speed in the North direction remains constant.\n",
