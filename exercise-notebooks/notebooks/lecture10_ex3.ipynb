    "`T_eff_cs` is probably significantly less good than the one obtained for the cumulative sums over the other dimensions, but still quite good if we keep in mind the `T_tot` achieved with the first memcopy manner in Task 5. A good strategy for tackling an optimal implementation would certainly be to use warp-level functions (and if needed a more complex summation algorithm)."
