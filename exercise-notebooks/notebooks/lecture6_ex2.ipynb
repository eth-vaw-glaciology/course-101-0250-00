    "\n",
    "In there, place the `diffusion_2D_loop_fun.jl` and `acoustic_2D_loop_fun.jl` scripts you created for lecture 5 homework. Duplicate both scripts and rename them as `diffusion_2D_gpu.jl` and `acoustic_2D_gpu.jl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting inspiration from the material presented in lecture 6 and exercise 1, work-out the necessary modifications in the `diffusion_2D_gpu.jl` and `acoustic_2D_gpu.jl` code in order to enable them to execute on the Nvidia Titan Xm GPU you have on your assigned *octopus* node. For this task, _**use a kernel programming approach**_.\n",

    "Define, in the `# Numerics` section, the parameters to set the block and grid size such that the number of threads per blocks are fixed to `cuthreads = (32,4)` (or to a better layout you could figure out repeating the performance assessment you did on node40 on your assigned Titan Xm based node). Define then the number of blocks `cublocks` to be computed such that `nx = cuthreads[1]*cublocks[1]` and similarly for `ny`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `# Array initialisation` section, make sure to now initialise CUDA arrays. You can use `CUDA.zeros(nx,ny)` as the GPU variant of `zeros(nx,ny)`. Also, you can use `CuArray()` to wrap and CPU array turning it into a GPU array; `CUDA.zeros()` would be equivalent to `CuArray(zeros(nx,ny))`. This may be useful to, e.g., define initial conditions using broadcasting operations on CPU arrays and wrapping them in a GPU array for further use.\n",
