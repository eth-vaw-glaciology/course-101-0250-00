This can be implicitly achieved by updating only the inner points of `C` with the divergence of the diffusive flux (i.e. `C[2:end-1]`). For the advection part, implement upwind scheme making sure to treat cases for both positive and negative velocities `vx`."

Confirm the if $Pe >> 100$ the diffusion happens in a much longer time compared to the advection, and the opposite for $Pe << 100$."
