    "In this first exercise, you will modify the diffusion-reaction example to model transient diffusion, but this time including not just the pseudo-time derivative $\\partial/\\partial\\tau$, but also the physical time derivative $\\partial/\\partial t$.\n",

    "where $\\mathrm{d}t$ is the physical time step, and $C_\\mathrm{old}$ is the concentration at the previous time step. If we discretise the spatial derivatives is a usual way and update $C$ using the explicit update rule, the maximum value for the time step is restricted by the stability criteria, and is proportional to the grid spacing $\\mathrm{d}x$. However, if we consider the $C$ to be from the implicit layer of the time integration scheme, we don't have that restriction anymore and are free to use any time step. The downside is that in this case we have to solve the linear system to get the values at the next time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "A close look at the equation with the discretised time derivative reveals that this equation is mathematically identical to the diffusion-reaction equation that we already learned how to solve! The value for the concentration at the old time step $C_\\mathrm{old}$ and the physical time step $\\mathrm{d}t$ correspond to the equilibrium concentration $C_\\mathrm{eq}$ and the time scale of reaction, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each physical time step the implicit problem could be solved using the PT method. Thus, there are present time derivatives both in physical time and in pseudo-time. This approach is therefore called _the dual-time method_. The code structure would include the two nested loops, one for the physical time and one for the pseudo-transient iterations:\n",

Add the new parameter `nt = 10` indicating the number of physical time steps. Wrap the iteration loop in the outer `for`-loop to make physical time steps. Move the visualisation outside from the iteration loop, so that the plots are only updated once per physical timestep (keeping error checking for iterations)."
