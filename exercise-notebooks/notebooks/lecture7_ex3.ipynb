    "### Tasks\n",
    "1. Add CI setup to your `PorousConvection` project to run **one unit and one reference test** for both the 2D and 3D thermal porous convection scripts.\n",
    "   - ðŸ‘‰ make sure that the reference test runs on a very small grid (without producing NaNs).  It should complete in less than, say, 10-20 seconds.\n",
    "2. Follow/revisit the lecture and in particular look at the example at [https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00-L6Testing-subfolder.jl](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00-L6Testing-subfolder.jl) to setup CI for a folder that is part of another Git repo (your `PorousConvection` folder is part of your `pde-on-gpu-<username>` git repo).\n",
    "3. Push to GitHub and make sure the CI runs and passes\n",
    "4. Add the CI-badge to the `README.md` file from your `PorousConvection` folder, right below the title (as it is commonly done).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may realise that you can't initialise ParallelStencil for 2D and 3D configurations within the same test script. A good practice is to place one test2D.jl and another test3D.jl scripts within the `test` folder and call these scripts from the `runtests.jl` mains script, which could contain following:"
