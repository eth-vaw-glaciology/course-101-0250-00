    "In this exercise you will implement the fully implicit and fully coupled solver for the thermal porous convection problem. Starting from the working solver that uses the explicit update for the temperature, you will introduce the pseudo-transient parameters for the implicit transient diffusion problem, and move the temperature update to the iteration loop. Then you will introduce the [Rayleigh number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_number) that characterises the intensity of the buoyancy-driven convection, and verify that your numerical code confirms the analytical predictions for the critical Rayleigh number separating the heat diffusion- and advection-dominated flow regimes."
