    "In this first exercise, you will finalise the thermal porous convection discussed and implemented in class. The following tasks combine the major steps needed to program 2D thermal porous convection starting from 1D steady state diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "Create a new folder named `lecture4` in your GitHub repository for this week's (lecture 4) exercises. In there, create a new Julia script named `porous_convection_2D.jl` for this homework. Take the 1D steady diffusion script `l3_steady_diffusion_1D.jl` as a basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1\n",
    "Rename variables so that we solve it for the pressure:\n",
    " - `C` should now be replaced by `Pf`\n",
    " - `qx` becomes `qDx` and should be initialised with size `nx+1`. Modify the rest of the code accordingly such that entire `Pf` array can be updated having the boundary condition set on the flux.\n",
    " - `dc` becomes `k_ηf` which is now the permeability over fluid viscosity\n",
    " - `dτ./(ρ*dc .+ dτ)` from flux update becomes `1.0./(1.0 + θ_dτ)`\n",
    " - `dτ` from pressure update becomes `β_dτ`. Note that instead of multiplying by `dτ` one should divide by `β_dτ`\n",

    "```\n",
    "and introduce `cfl = 1.0/sqrt(2.1)` in the numerics section. Also, `ρ` is no longer needed and we can move `re` to numerics section as well.\n",
