    "- Define your own `diff()` function as `@views Diff(A) = A[2:end].-A[1:end-1]`\n",
    "- Create a Julia project `L6TestingExercise` within the exercise submission folder `lecture6`.  Use the `generate` command of the REPL package-mode.\n",
    "- Add `l2_diffusion_1D.jl` to a `scripts/` folder\n",
    "- You should remove/disable the plotting. This will make the tests run faster. Remove the `@views` for the main function. Also return the final `C` and `qx` from the function.\n",
    "- Make two unit tests for `Diff(A)` function; wrap them in a `@testset`\n",
    "- Make a reference-test which tests the value at 20 random indices of `C` and `qx` against a truth.\n",
    "- Make sure that all tests run and pass when called via package-mode `test`"
