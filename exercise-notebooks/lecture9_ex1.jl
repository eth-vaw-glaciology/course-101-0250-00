## Exercise 1 - **Push-ups with memory copy**
"""

#md # 👉 See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details (this exercise don't need to be handed-in).

md"""
The goal of this exercise is to:
- refresh how to establish the peak memory throughput of your GPU
"""

md"""
### Getting started

👉 Download the introduction notebook *Benchmarking memory copy and establishing peak memory access performance* ([`l6_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb`](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/blob/main/slide-notebooks/notebooks/l6_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb))

Then run the notebook to establish the performance baseline *(you should have a copy of it in your `lecture09` folder on octopus)*.
