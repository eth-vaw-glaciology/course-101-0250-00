# Exercises - lecture 11

\warn{**Exercise 1** is the final step of your project - scripts and results should be added to the `PorousConvection` subfolder in your private GitHub repo. The git commit hash (or SHA) of the final push needs to be uploaded on Moodle ([more](/homework)).\
From your `homework-9` branch, create a new git branch named `homework-11` in order to build upon work performed for homework 9.\
The exercises from Lecture 11 include the last steps towards the completion of the project. Hand-in information can be found in [Logistics](/logistics/#project).}
