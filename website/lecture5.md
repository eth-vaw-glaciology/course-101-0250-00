# Exercises - lecture 5

\warn{Exercises have to be handed in as monolithic Julia scripts (one code per script) and uploaded to your private (shared) GitHub repository, in a **specific folder for each lecture**. The git commit hash (or SHA) of the final push needs to be uploaded on Moodle ([more](/homework)).}
