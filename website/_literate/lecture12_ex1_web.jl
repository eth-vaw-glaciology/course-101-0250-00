## Exercise 1 — **Push-ups with memory copy**
"""

#md # 👉 See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details (this exercise doesn't need to be handed-in).

md"""
The goal of this exercise is to:
- ensure you can run a Julia notebook on Daint.Alps
- refresh how to establish the peak memory throughput of your GPU

### Getting started

👉 Make sure:
1. Log into your [JupyterLab](/software_install/#jupyterlab_access_on_alps) on Daint.Alps
2. Download the [`l7_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb`](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/blob/main/notebooks/l7_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb) notebooks and copy it to your `scratch` space on Daint.Alps.
4. Open the introduction notebook *Benchmarking memory copy and establishing peak memory access performance* [`l7_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb`](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/blob/main/notebooks/l7_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb)
5. Run the notebook to establish the performance baseline (you will need the value in the next exercises).
