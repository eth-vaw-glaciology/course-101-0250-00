## Exercise 1 - **Implicit transient diffusion using dual timestepping**

ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

The goal of this exercise is to:
- Implement transient diffusion solver with implicit time integration using pseudo-transient method
- Grasp the difference between physical time stepping and pseudo-transient iterations

Dual time-stepping. Introduce formal equivalence between diffusion-reaction (that we code on the lecture) and Euler time integration, task to wrap code in the time loop.
