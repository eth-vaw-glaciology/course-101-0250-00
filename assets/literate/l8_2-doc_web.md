### Why should I document my code?

Why should I write code comments?
- ["Code Tells You How, Comments Tell You Why"](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/)
  - code should be made understandable by itself, as much as possible
  - comments then should be to tell the "why" you're doing something
- *but* I do a lot of structuring comments as well
- math-y variables tend to be short and need a comment as well

Why should I write documentation?
- documentation should give a bigger overview of what your code does
  - at the function-level (doc-strings)
  - at the package-level (README, full-fledged documentation)
- to let other people and your future self (probably most important) understand what
  your code is about

### Documentation easily rots...

Worse than no documentation/code comments is documentation which is
outdated.

I find the best way to keep documentation up to date is:
- have documentation visible to you, e.g. GitHub README
- document what you need yourself
- use examples and run them as part of CI (doc-tests, example-scripts)

### Documentation tools: doc-strings

A Julia doc-string ([Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/)):
- is just a string before the object (no new-line); interpreted as markdown-string
- can be attached to most things (functions, variables, modules, macros, types)
- can be queried with `?`

````julia:ex1
"""
    transform(r, Î¸) = (r*cos(Î¸), r*sin(Î¸))

Transform polar to cartesian coordinates.
"""
transform(r, Î¸) = (r*cos(Î¸), r*sin(Î¸))

"Typical size of beer crate"
const BEERBOX = 12
````

````julia:ex2
?BEERBOX
````

### Documentation tools: doc-strings with examples

One can add examples to doc-strings (they can even be part of testing: [doc-tests](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/man/doctests/)).

- run it in the REPL and copy paste to the docstring

````julia:ex3
"""
    transform(r, Î¸) = (r*cos(Î¸), r*sin(Î¸))

Transform polar to cartesian coordinates.

# Example
```jldoctest
julia> transform(4.5, pi/5)
(3.6405764746872635, 2.6450336353161292)
```
"""
transform(r, Î¸) = (r*cos(Î¸), r*sin(Î¸))
````

````julia:ex4
?transform
````

### Documentation tools: Github markdown rendering

The easiest way to write long-form documentation is to just use GitHub's markdown rendering.

A nice example is [this short course](https://github.com/luraess/parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21#parallel-cpu-implementation)
by Ludovic (incidentally about solving PDEs on GPUs ðŸ™‚).

- images are rendered
- in-page links are easy, e.g. `[_back to workshop material_](#workshop-material)`
- top-left has a burger-menu for page navigation
- can be edited within the web-page (pencil-icon)

ðŸ‘‰ this is a good and low-overhead way to produce pretty nice documentation

### Documentation tools: Literate.jl

There are several tools which render .jl files (with special formatting) into
markdown files.  These files can then be added to Github and will be rendered there.

- we're using [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl)
- format is described [here](https://fredrikekre.github.io/Literate.jl/v2/fileformat/)
- files stay valid Julia scripts, i.e. they can be executed without Literate.jl


Example
- output markdown in: [course-101-0250-00-L8Documentation.jl: scripts/car_travels.jl](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00-L8Documentation.jl/blob/4bbeb3ddda046490847f050b02d3fc5d9308695b/scripts/car_travels.jl)
- output markdown in: [course-101-0250-00-L8Documentation.jl: scripts/car_travels.md](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00-L8Documentation.jl/blob/4bbeb3ddda046490847f050b02d3fc5d9308695b/scripts/car_travels.md)
```
Literate.markdown("car_travels.jl", directory_of_this_file, execute=true, documenter=false, credit=false)
```

But this is not automatic!  Manual steps: run Literate, add files, commit and push...

### Documentation tools: Automating Literate.jl

As is done on [course-101-0250-00-L8Documentation.jl](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00-L8Documentation.jl)
```yml
name: Run Literate.jl
# adapted from https://lannonbr.com/blog/2019-12-09-git-commit-in-actions

on: push

jobs:
  lit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout the branch
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1
        with:
          version: '1.8'
          arch: x64

      - uses: actions/cache@v1
        env:
          cache-name: cache-artifacts
        with:
          path: ~/.julia/artifacts
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-test-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/Project.toml') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-test-${{ env.cache-name }}-
            ${{ runner.os }}-test-
            ${{ runner.os }}-

      - uses: julia-actions/julia-buildpkg@v1

      - name: run Literate
        run: julia --color=yes --project -e 'cd("scripts"); include("literate-script.jl")'

      - name: setup git config
        run: |
          # setup the username and email. I tend to use 'GitHub Actions Bot' with no email by default
          git config user.name "GitHub Actions Bot"
          git config user.email "<>"

      - name: commit
        run: |
          # Stage the file, commit and push
          git add scripts/md/*
          git commit -m "Commit markdown files fom Literate"
          git push origin master
```

### Documentation tools: Documenter.jl

If you want to have full-blown documentation, including, e.g., automatic API documentation generation, versioning,
then use [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl).

Examples:
- [https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)
- [https://mauro3.github.io/Parameters.jl/stable/](https://mauro3.github.io/Parameters.jl/stable/)

_**Notes:**_
- it's geared towards Julia-packages, less for a bunch-of-scripts as in our lecture
- Documenter.jl also integrates with Literate.jl.
- for more free-form websites, use [https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl) (as the course website does)
- if you want to use it, it's easiest to generate your package with [PkgTemplates.jl](https://github.com/invenia/PkgTemplates.jl)
  which will generate the Documenter-setup for you.
