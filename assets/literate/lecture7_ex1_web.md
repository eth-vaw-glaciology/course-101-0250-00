## Exercise 1 - **2D thermal porous convection xPU implementation**

ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

The goal of this exercise is to:
- Finalise the xPU implementation of the 2D fluid diffusion solver started in class
- Familiarise with xPU programming, `@parallel` and `@parallel_indices`
- Port your 2D thermal porous convection code to xPU implementation
- Create your repository to host the first course project

In this exercise, you will finalise the 2D fluid diffusion solver started during lecture 7 and use the new xPU scripts as starting point to port your 2D thermal porous convection code.
