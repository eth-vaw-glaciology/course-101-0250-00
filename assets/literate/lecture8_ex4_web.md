## Exercise 4 - **Automatic documentation in Julia**

ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

The goal of this exercise is to:
- write some documentation
  - using [doc-strings](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/)
  - using [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl)

One task you've already done, namely to update the README.md of this set of exercises!

Tasks:
- add doc-string to the functions you created for this exercise
- turn the script of Exercise 3 into a Literate.jl script. Compile it to markdown, git-add the output (both `.md`-file and any figures) and push it.
