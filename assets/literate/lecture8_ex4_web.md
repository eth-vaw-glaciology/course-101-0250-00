## Exercise 4 - **Automatic documentation in Julia**

ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

The goal of this exercise is to:
- write some documentation
  - doc-strings
  - using Literate.jl

One task you've already done, namely to update the README.md of this set of exercises!

Tasks:
- add doc-string to the functions you created for this exercise
- turn the script of Ex3 into a Literate.jl script.  Compile it to markdown,
  git-add the output (both md-file and any figures) and push it.
