# Solving partial differential equations in parallel on GPUs

## The Team

- Ludovic RÃ¤ss -- _the good_

- Samuel Omlin -- _the bad_

- Mauro Werder -- _the ugly_

## Logistics

All you need should be available on the course website:\
[https://eth-vaw-glaciology.github.io/course-101-0250-00/](https://eth-vaw-glaciology.github.io/course-101-0250-00/)

> If something is missing, ping us so we can add it (_or even better_ do a pull request\
> at [https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/))

Let's have a brief tour of the [course website](https://eth-vaw-glaciology.github.io/course-101-0250-00/)

### Discussion & help

We plan to use the Element-chat as the main communication channel for the course, both between the teachers and the student, and hopefully also between students.

Join [Element (https://chat.ethz.ch/)](https://chat.ethz.ch/) by logging in with you NETHZ usernam & password.
  - Login link is available on [Moodle](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/mod/url/view.php?id=632283).
  - Join the _**General**_ (course infos) and _**Heldesk**_ (exercises Q&A) rooms.

### Grading

- Weekly exercises (7/9) as homework (alone or groups of 2) **40%**
- Final project (groups of 2) **60%**

## Computing

Bring your laptop to all lectures!

- Who has access to an Nvidia GPU?
- What operating system are you on?

In the first few lecture we will use JupyterHub to get you started. Later we plan to get you all setup with a personal Julia installation.

## Summary

- (Almost) All infos on [https://eth-vaw-glaciology.github.io/course-101-0250-00/](https://eth-vaw-glaciology.github.io/course-101-0250-00/)
- Get started with [Element (https://chat.ethz.ch/)](https://chat.ethz.ch/)

If some important info is missing, ping us so we can add it

_This is the first time we run this course, things will be missing!_  Help is appreciated.
