# Solving partial differential equations in parallel on GPUs

## The Team

- Ludovic Räss — _the good_

- Samuel Omlin — _the bad_

- Mauro Werder — _the ugly_

- Ivan Utkin — _the talking head_

- You Wu — _the teaching assistant_

## Logistics

All the information should be available on the course's website:\
[https://pde-on-gpu.vaw.ethz.ch](https://pde-on-gpu.vaw.ethz.ch)

> If something is missing, let us know so we can add it, or _even better_, submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests/)
> to [the course's repository](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/)

### Discussion & help

- We use the chat on Element as the main communication channel for the course
- Communication between students is encouraged
- Join [Element (https://chat.ethz.ch/)](https://chat.ethz.ch/) by logging in with you NETHZ username & password
  - Login link is available on [Moodle](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=23586)
  - Join the _**General**_ room for course-related information
  - Join the _**Helpdesk**_ room for exercises Q&A

## Grading

All homework assignements can be done either alone or in groups of two. However, **note that every student has to hand in a personal version of the homework**.

- 6 Weekly exercises in Part 1 and Part 2 of the course as homework — **30%**
  - Best five out of six are graded
- Consolidation project, developed during Part 3 of the course — **35%**
- Final project — **35%**

## Computing

Bring your laptop to all lectures!

- Who has access to an Nvidia / AMD GPU?
- What operating system are you on?

In the first two lectures we will use JupyterHub. Later you will setup a personal Julia installation.
