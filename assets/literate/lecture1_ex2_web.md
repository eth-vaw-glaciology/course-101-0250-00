## Exercise 2 - **Car travel in 2 dimensions**

ðŸ‘‰ [Download the notebook to get started with this exercise!](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/blob/main/exercise-notebooks/notebooks/lecture1_ex2.ipynb)

\warn{Write a monolithic Julia script to solve this exercise in a Jupyter notebook and hand it in on Moodle ([more](/homework)).}

The goal of this exercise is to familiarise with:
- code structure `# Physics, # Numerics, # Time loop, # Visualisation`
- array initialisation
- 2 spatial dimensions
- solving ODEs

Based on the experience you acquired solving the [Exercise 1](#exercise_1_-_car_travel) we can now consider a car moving within a 2-dimensional space. The car still travels at speed $V=113$ km/h, but now in North-East or North-West direction. The West-East and South-North directions being the $x$ and $y$ axis, respectively. The car's displacement in the West-East directions is limited to $L=200$ km. The speed in the North direction remains constant.

Starting from the 1D code done in [Exercise 1](#exercise_1_-_car_travel), work towards adding the second spatial dimension. Now, the car's position $(x,y)$ as function of time $t$ has two components.

\note{- Split velocity magnitude $V$ into $x$ and $y$ component
- Use `sind()` or `cosd()` functions if passing the angle in _deg_ instead of _rad_
- Use two vectors or an array to store the car's coordinates
- Define the y-axis extend in the plot `ylims=(0, ttot*Vy)`}

### Question 1

Visualise graphically the trajectory of the travelling car for a simulation with time step parameter defined as `dt = 0.1`.
