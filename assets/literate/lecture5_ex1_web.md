## Exercise 1 - **Performance implementation**

ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

The goal of this exercise is to:
- Finalise the script discussed in class

In this first exercise, you will terminate the performance oriented implementation of the 2D fluid pressure (diffusion) solver script from lecture 5.

ðŸ‘‰ If needed, download the [`l5_Pf_diffusion_2D.jl`](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/blob/main/scripts/) to get you started.

### Task 1

Create a new folder in your GitHub repository for this week's (lecture 5) exercises. In there, create a new subfolder `Pf_diffusion_2D` where you will add following script:
- `Pf_diffusion_2D_Teff.jl`: `T_eff` implementation
- `Pf_diffusion_2D_perf.jl`: scalar precomputations and removing disabling `ncheck`
- `Pf_diffusion_2D_loop_fun.jl`: physics computations in `compute!()` function, derivatives done with macros, and multi-threading

\note{Refer to [this section](#timer_and_performance) in lecture 5 to capture the starting point describing which features are specific to each version of the diffusion 2D codes.}
