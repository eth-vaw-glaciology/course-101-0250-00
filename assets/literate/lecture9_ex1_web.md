## Exercise 1 - **Push-ups with memory copy**

ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details (this exercise doesn't need to be handed-in).

The goal of this exercise is to:
- ensure you can run a Julia notebook on your octopus node
- refresh how to establish the peak memory throughput of your GPU

### Getting started

ðŸ‘‰ Make sure:
1. You are logged-in to your node on octopus ([how-to](/software_install/#login_to_your_node))
2. Head to `/scratch/<username>/lecture09/`
3. Get your Julia environment ready so that you can [start a Jupyter notebook server](/software_install/#running_a_jupyter_notebook)
4. Open the introduction notebook *Benchmarking memory copy and establishing peak memory access performance* (`/scratch/<username>/lecture09/l6_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb`)
5. Run the notebook to establish the performance baseline *(you should have a copy of it in your `lecture09` folder on octopus)*.
