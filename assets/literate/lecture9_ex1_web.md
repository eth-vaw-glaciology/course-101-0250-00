## Exercise 1 - **Push-ups with memory copy**

ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details (this exercise don't need to be handed-in).

The goal of this exercise is to:
- refresh how to establish the peak memory throughput of your GPU

### Getting started

ðŸ‘‰ Download the introduction notebook *Benchmarking memory copy and establishing peak memory access performance* ([`l6_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb`](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/blob/main/slide-notebooks/notebooks/l6_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb))

Then run the notebook to establish the performance baseline *(you should have a copy of it in your `lecture09` folder on octopus)*.
