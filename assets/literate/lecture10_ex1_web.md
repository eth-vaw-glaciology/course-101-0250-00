## Exercise 1 - **Push-ups with memory copy**

ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details (this exercise doesn't need to be handed-in).

The goal of this exercise is to:
- ensure you can run a Julia notebook on your octopus node
- refresh how to establish the peak memory throughput of your GPU

### Getting started

ðŸ‘‰ Make sure:
1. Log into your [JupyterLab](/software_install/#jupyterhub) on Piz Daint
2. Download the [`l6_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb`](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/blob/main/slide-notebooks/notebooks/l6_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb) notebooks and copy it to your `scratch` space on Piz Daint.
4. Open the introduction notebook *Benchmarking memory copy and establishing peak memory access performance* [`l6_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb`](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/blob/main/slide-notebooks/notebooks/l6_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb)
5. Run the notebook to establish the performance baseline (you will need the value in the next exercises).
