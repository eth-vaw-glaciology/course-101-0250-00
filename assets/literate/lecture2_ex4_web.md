## Exercise 4 - **Julia install and Git repo**

The goal of this homework is to:
- finalise your local Julia install
- create a private git repo to upload your homework

As final homework task for this second lecture, you will have to
1. Finalise your local Julia install
2. Create a private git repository on GitHub and share it only with the teaching staff

### Julia install
Ensure you have access to latest version of Julia, access and a fully functional REPL (command window) and you can visualise script output graphically when, e.g., plotting something

```julia
using Plots
display(heatmap(rand(10,10)))
```

### Git repository
Once you have your GitHub account ready, create a private repository you will _**share with the teaching staff only**_ to upload your weekly assignments (scripts).
