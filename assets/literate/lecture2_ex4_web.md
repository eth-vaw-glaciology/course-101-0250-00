## Exercise 4 - **Julia install and Git repo**

The goal of this homework is to:
- have a local Julia install
- create a private git repo to upload your homework

As final homework task for this second lecture, you will have to
1. Finalise your local Julia install
2. Create a private git repository on GitHub and share it only with the teaching staff

For (1) the Julia install, ensure you have access to latest version of Julia, access and full functionality of the REPL (command window) and you can visualise script output graphically when, e.g., plotting something

```julia
using Plots
display(heatmap(rand(10,10)))
```

For (2) the Git repository, once you have your GitHub account ready, create a private repository you will share with the teaching staff only to upload your weekly assignments (scripts).
