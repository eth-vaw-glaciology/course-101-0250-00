## Exercise 4 - **CI and GitHub Actions**

ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

The goal of this exercise is to:
- setup Continuous Integration with Github Actions

Task:
- copy the repository you created for Lecture6-Exercise3 over to your Lecture7 solution folder as `L7CIExercise` (if you did not complete that exercise, use the package https://github.com/mauro3/SimpleTraits.jl instead, make sure to not copy over the `.github` and `.git` folders)
- follow/revisit the lecture and in particular look at the example at [https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00-L6Testing-subfolder.jl](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00-L6Testing-subfolder.jl)
to setup CI
- push to github and make sure the CI runs and passes
- add the badge to the folder-local README.md

*Remember to check-in all the files into the repo; in particular the reference `*.bson`.
