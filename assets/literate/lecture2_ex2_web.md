## Exercise 2 - **Reaction-Diffusion**

ðŸ‘‰ [Download the notebook to get started with this exercise!](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/blob/main/exercise-notebooks/notebooks/lecture2_ex2.ipynb)

\warn{Write a monolithic Julia script to solve this exercise in a Jupyter notebook and hand it in on Moodle ([more](/homework)).}

The goal of this exercise is to consolidate:
- 1D reaction-diffusion
- Non-dimensional numbers

The goal of this exercise is to combine reaction and diffusion processes acting on the concentration of a quantity $C$.

From what you learned in class, write an reaction-diffusion code having following physical input parameters:

```
# Physics
Lx    = 10.0  # domain length
D     = 0.4   # diffusion coefficient
Î¾     = 10.0  # reaction rate
Ceq   = 0.4   # equilibrium concentration
ttot  = 2.0   # total simulation time
```

Discretise your domain in 128 finite-difference cells such that the first cell centre is located at `dx/2` and the last cell centre at `Lx-dx/2`. Use following explicit time step limiters:

```julia
dt    = dx^2/D/2.2
```

As initial condition, define a Gaussian profile of concentration `C` of amplitude and standard deviation equal to 1, located at `0.3*Lx`.

Keep the concentration at the boundaries at `C=0`.

\note{Don't forget to initialise (pre-allocate) all arrays (vectors) needed in the calculations.}

### Question 1

Report the initial and final distribution of concentration on a figure with axis-label, title, and plotted line labels. Also, report on the figure (as text in one label of your choice) the maximal final concentration value and its $x$ location.

### Question 2

Repeat the exercise but introduce the non-dimensional [DamkÃ¶hler number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DamkÃ¶hler_numbers) $Da = L^2/D/Î¾$ as physical quantity defining the diffusion coefficient D as a `# Derived physics` quantity. Confirm the if $Da < 0.1$ most of the mass diffuses away from $C_{eq}$, and the opposite holds for $Da > 10$.
