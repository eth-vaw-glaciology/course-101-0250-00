## Exercise 2 - **3D thermal porous convection xPU implementation**

üëâ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

The goal of this exercise is to:
- Create a 3D xPU implementation of the 2D thermal porous convection code
- Familiarise with 3D and xPU programming, `@parallel` and `@parallel_indices`
- Include 3D visualisation using [`Makie.jl`](https://docs.makie.org/stable/)

In this exercise, you will finalise the 3D fluid diffusion solver started during lecture 7 and use the new xPU scripts as starting point to port your 3D thermal porous convection code.

For this first exercise, we will finalise and add to the `scripts` folder within the `PorousConvection` folder following scripts:
- `Pf_diffusion_3D_xpu.jl`
- `PorousConvection_3D_xpu.jl`

### Task 1

Finalise the `Pf_diffusion_3D_xpu.jl` script from class.
- This version should contain compute functions (kernels) definitions using `@parallel` approach together with using `ParallelStencil.FiniteDifferences3D` submodule.
- Include the kwarg `do_visu` (or `do_check`) to allow disabling plotting/error-checking when assessing performance.
- Also, make sure to include and update the performance evaluation section at the end of the script.

### Task 2

Merge the `PorousConvection_2D_xpu.jl` from Exercise 1 and the `Pf_diffusion_3D_xpu.jl` script from previous task to create a 3D single xPU `PorousConvection_3D_xpu.jl` version to run on GPUs.

Implement similar changes as you did for the 2D script in Exercise 1, preferring the `@parallel` (instead of `@parallel_indices`) whenever possible.

Make sure to use the `z`-direction as the vertical coordinate changing all relevant expressions in the code, and assume `Œ±œÅg` to be the gravity acceleration acting only in the `z`-direction. Implement following domain extend and numerical resolution (ratio):

````julia:ex1
# physics
lx,ly,lz    = 40.0,20.0,20.0
Œ±œÅg         = 1.0
Ra          = 1000
Œª_œÅCp       = 1/Ra*(Œ±œÅg*k_Œ∑f*ŒîT*lz/œï) # Ra = Œ±œÅg*k_Œ∑f*ŒîT*lz/Œª_œÅCp/œï
# numerics
nz          = 63
ny          = nz
nx          = 2*(nz+1)-1
nt          = 500
cfl         = 1.0/sqrt(3.1)
````

Also, modify the physical time-step definition accordingly:

````julia:ex2
dt = if it == 1
    0.1*min(dx,dy,dz)/(Œ±œÅg*ŒîT*k_Œ∑f)
else
    min(5.0*min(dx,dy,dz)/(Œ±œÅg*ŒîT*k_Œ∑f),œï*min(dx/maximum(abs.(qDx)), dy/maximum(abs.(qDy)), dz/maximum(abs.(qDz)))/3.1)
end
````

### Task 3

Upon having verified the your code, run it with higher resolution on Piz Daint, using one GPU.

üöß final details to come on what to hand in and display in the PorousConvection project subfolder `README`.
