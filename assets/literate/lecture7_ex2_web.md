## Exercise 2 - **3D thermal porous convection xPU implementation**

üëâ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

The goal of this exercise is to:
- Create a 3D xPU implementation of the 2D thermal porous convection code
- Familiarise with 3D and xPU programming, `@parallel` and `@parallel_indices`
- Include 3D visualisation using [`Makie.jl`](https://docs.makie.org/stable/)

In this exercise, you will finalise the 3D fluid diffusion solver started during lecture 7 and use the new xPU scripts as starting point to port your 3D thermal porous convection code.

For this first exercise, we will finalise and add to the `scripts` folder within the `PorousConvection` folder following scripts:
- `Pf_diffusion_3D_xpu.jl`
- `PorousConvection_3D_xpu.jl`

### Task 1

Finalise the `Pf_diffusion_3D_xpu.jl` script from class.
- This version should contain compute functions (kernels) definitions using `@parallel` approach together with using `ParallelStencil.FiniteDifferences3D` submodule.
- Include the `kwargs` `do_visu` (or `do_check`) to allow disabling plotting/error-checking when assessing performance.
- Also, make sure to include and update the performance evaluation section at the end of the script.

### Task 2

Merge the `PorousConvection_2D_xpu.jl` from Exercise 1 and the `Pf_diffusion_3D_xpu.jl` script from previous task to create a 3D single xPU `PorousConvection_3D_xpu.jl` version to run on GPUs.

Implement similar changes as you did for the 2D script in Exercise 1, preferring the `@parallel` (instead of `@parallel_indices`) whenever possible.

Make sure to use the `z`-direction as the vertical coordinate changing all relevant expressions in the code, and assume `Œ±œÅg` to be the gravity acceleration acting only in the `z`-direction. Implement following domain extend and numerical resolution (ratio):

````julia:ex1
# physics
lx,ly,lz    = 40.0,20.0,20.0
Œ±œÅg         = 1.0
Ra          = 1000
Œª_œÅCp       = 1/Ra*(Œ±œÅg*k_Œ∑f*ŒîT*lz/œï) # Ra = Œ±œÅg*k_Œ∑f*ŒîT*lz/Œª_œÅCp/œï
# numerics
nz          = 63
ny          = nz
nx          = 2*(nz+1)-1
nt          = 500
cfl         = 1.0/sqrt(3.1)
````

Also, modify the physical time-step definition accordingly:

````julia:ex2
dt = if it == 1
    0.1*min(dx,dy,dz)/(Œ±œÅg*ŒîT*k_Œ∑f)
else
    min(5.0*min(dx,dy,dz)/(Œ±œÅg*ŒîT*k_Œ∑f),œï*min(dx/maximum(abs.(qDx)), dy/maximum(abs.(qDy)), dz/maximum(abs.(qDz)))/3.1)
end
````

Initial conditions for temperature can be done by analogy to the 2D case, but using the iterative approach presented in class (see [here](#towards_3d_thermal_porous_convection)).

````julia:ex3
T = [ŒîT*exp(-xc[ix]^2 -yc[iy]^2 -(zc[iz]+lz/2)^2) for ix=1:nx,iy=1:ny,iz=1:nz]
````

Make sure to have `yc` defined using extends similar to `xc`, and `zc` being the vertical dimension.

For boundary conditions, apply heating from the bottom (zc=-lz) and cooling from top `zc=0` in the vertical `z`-direction. Extend the adiabatic condition for the walls to the `xz` and `yz` planes. The `yz` BC kernel could be defined and called as following:

````julia:ex4
@parallel_indices (iy,iz) function bc_x!(A)
    A[1  ,iy,iz] = A[2    ,iy,iz]
    A[end,iy,iz] = A[end-1,iy,iz]
    return
end

@parallel (1:size(T,2),1:size(T,3)) bc_x!(T)
````

Verify that the code runs using the above low-resolution configuration and produces sensible output. To this end, you can recycle the 2D visualisation (removing the quiver plotting) in order to visualise a 2D slice of your 3D data, e.g., at `ly/2`:

````julia:ex5
iframe = 0
if do_viz && (it % nvis == 0)
    p1=heatmap(xc,zc,Array(T)[:,ceil(Int,ny/2),:]';xlims=(xc[1],xc[end]),ylims=(zc[1],zc[end]),aspect_ratio=1,c=:turbo)
    png(p1,@sprintf("viz3D_out/%04d.png",iframe+=1))
end
````

### Task 3

Upon having verified your code, run it with following parameters on Piz Daint, using one GPU:

````julia:ex6
Ra       = 1000
# [...]
nx,ny,nz = 255,127,127
nt       = 2000
œµtol     = 1e-6
nvis     = 50
ncheck   = ceil(2max(nx,ny,nz))
````

The run may take about three hours so make sure to allocate sufficiently resources and time on daint. You can use a non-interactive `sbatch` submission script in such cases (see [here](https://user.cscs.ch/access/running/) for the "official" docs). _You can find a `l7_runme3D.sh` script in the [scripts](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/course-101-0250-00/blob/main/scripts/) folder._

Produce a figure showing the final stage of temperature distribution and add it to a new section titled `## Porous convection 3D` in the `PorousConvection` project subfolder's `README`.

For the figure, you can use `GLMakie` to produce some isocontours visualisation; add the following binary dump function to your code

````julia:ex7
function save_array(Aname,A)
    fname = string(Aname,".bin")
    out = open(fname,"w"); write(out,A); close(out)
end
````

which you can call as following at the end of your simulation

````julia:ex8
save_array("out_T",convert.(Float32,Array(T)))
````

Then, once you've created the `out_T.bin` file, read it in using the following code and produce a figure

````julia:ex9
using GLMakie

function load_array(Aname,A)
    fname = string(Aname,".bin")
    fid=open(fname,"r"); read!(fid,A); close(fid)
end

function visualise()
    lx,ly,lz = 40.0,20.0,20.0
    nx = 255
    ny = nz = 127
    T  = zeros(Float32,nx,ny,nz)
    load_array("out_T",T)
    xc,yc,zc = LinRange(0,lx,nx),LinRange(0,ly,ny),LinRange(0,lz,nz)
    fig      = Figure(resolution=(1600,1000),fontsize=24)
    ax       = Axis3(fig[1,1];aspect=(1,1,0.5),title="Temperature",xlabel="lx",ylabel="ly",zlabel="lz")
    surf_T   = contour!(ax,xc,yc,zc,T;alpha=0.05,colormap=:turbo)
    save("T_3D.png",fig)
    return fig
end

visualise()
````

This figure you can further add to your `README.md`. Note that GLMakie will probably not run on Piz Daint as GL rendering is not enabled on the compute nodes.

For reference, the 3D figure produced could look as following

![3D porous convection](../assets/literate_figures/l7_ex2_porous_convect.png)

And the 2D slice at `y/2` rendered using `Plots.jl` displays as
