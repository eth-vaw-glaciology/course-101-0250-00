## Exercise 2 - **3D thermal porous convection xPU implementation**

ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

The goal of this exercise is to:
- Create a 3D xPU implementation of the 2D thermal porous convection code
- Familiarise with 3D and xPU programming, `@parallel` and `@parallel_indices`
- Include 3D visualisation using [`Makie.jl`](https://docs.makie.org/stable/)
