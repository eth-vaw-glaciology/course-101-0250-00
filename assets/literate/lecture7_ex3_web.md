## Exercise 3 - **Cauchy-Navier elastic waves**

ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

The goal of this exercise is to:
- Familiarise with Cauch-Navier elasticity
- Step from acoustic waves to elastic waves
- Get a glimpse into solid mechanics

### Getting started

In this exercises your task will be to terminate the 2D implementation of an elastic wave solver based on the [Cauchy-Navier elasticity as presented in lecture 7](#towards_stokes_flow_i_acoustic_to_elastic).

In class, we stopped at [**Task 2**](#task_2_-_adding_normal_stresses), adding normal stress components.

The remaining 2 tasks to achieve a full implementation of the 2D elastic wave solver are:
- adding shear stresses
- re-arranging the order of computation

Create a folder titles `elastic2D` within this week's lecture 7 GitHub parent folder. Copy in there the following codes developed in class (refer to the [course section](#towards_stokes_flow_i_acoustic_to_elastic) for directions regarding details implementing these 3 code versions):
- `acoustic_2D_elast0.jl`
- `acoustic_2D_elast1.jl`
- `acoustic_2D_elast2.jl`

### Task 3 - adding shear stresses

Start by making a new duplicate of the latest `acoustic_2D_elast2.jl` script, renaming it `acoustic_2D_elast3.jl`. In this new script, add the shear stress $xy$ component:
```julia
Ï„xy  .= Ï„xy .+ ??
```

Note that the strain(-rate) tensor is symmetric, thus $Ï„_{xy} = Ï„_{yx}$.

Make sure to correctly interpret [Einstein's notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation) - normal and shear stresses are not defined in the same way.

\note{Transforming [Einstein's notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation) into code: rate of change of normal stress $âˆ‚Ï„_{xx}/âˆ‚t$ is defined as $2~Î¼~(âˆ‚v_x/âˆ‚x -1/3âˆ‡v)$, i.e. two $2Î¼$ times the normal strain-rate. For the rate of change of the shear stress $âˆ‚Ï„_{xy}/âˆ‚t$, the shear strain-rate defines as $1/2~(âˆ‚v_x/âˆ‚y + âˆ‚v_y/âˆ‚x)$. Make sure to implement it consistently.}

### Task 4 - rearranging the code

For enhanced stability of the elastic solver, it is important to use the newly computed quantities as soon as possible.

Create a last duplicate of the `acoustic_2D_elast3.jl` script, renaming it `elastic_2D.jl`.

In this final version of the script, move the pressure calculations as the beginning of the time loop, to use update pressure within the velocity update.

You should now have a 2D elastic solver up and running ðŸš€

### Final Task

Compare the results between acoustic and elastic wave propagation for identical physical and numerical input parameters. Create one figure for each simulation that you add to the `README` in a new final section. Comment briefly about the results.
