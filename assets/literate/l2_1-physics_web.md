## ODEs
Simple reaction equation, finite-difference method and explicit solution

Let's take-off ðŸš€

Our first task is to design a numerical solution approach for the following reaction process (e.g. [reaction kinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_kinetics))

$$
\frac{âˆ‚C}{âˆ‚t} = -\frac{C-C_{eq}}{Î¾}~,
$$

where $C$ is the concentration of ,e.g. a specific chemical quantity, $t$ is time, $C_{eq}$ is the equilibrium concentration of $C$ and $Î¾$ is the reaction rate.

Suppose the reaction kinetics process occurs in a spatial domain (x-direction) of $Lx=10.0$, consider a reaction rate $Î¾=10.0$ and an equilibrium concentration $C_{eq}=0.5$.

The goal is now to predict the evolution of a system with initial random distribution of concentration $C$ in the range $[0, 1]$ for non-dimensional total time of $20.0$.

```julia:ex1
# Physics
Lx   = 10.0
Î¾    = 10.0
Ceq  = 0.5
ttot = 20.0
```

As next step, one needs to discretise the continuum problem in both space and time. We will use a [finite-difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference) spatial discretisation and an explicit ([forward Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method)) time integration scheme.

In a new `# Numerics` section we define the number of grid points we will use to discretise our physical domain $Lx$.

Then, in a `# Derived numerics` section, we compute the grid size `dx`, the time-step `dt`, the number of time-steps `nt` and the vector containing the coordinate of all cell centres `xc`.

```julia:ex2
# Numerics
nx   = 128
# Derived numerics
dx   = Lx/nx
dt   = Î¾/2.0
nt   = cld(ttot, dt)
xc   = LinRange(dx/2, Lx-dx/2, nx)
```

\note{type `?` in the Julia REPL followed by the function you want to know more about to display infos}

We now need to initialise 3 1D arrays to hold information about concentration `C`, initial concentration distribution `Ci`, and rate of change of concentration `dCdt`.

```julia:ex3
# Array initialisation
C    =  rand(Float64, nx)
Ci   =  copy(C)
dCdt = zeros(Float64, nx)
```

\note{note we here work with double precision arithmetic `Float64`}

Remains the most important part, the `# Time loop` where _predictive_ action should take place. We will loop from `it=1` to `nt` computing the rate of change of `C`, `dCdt`, and then updating `C`. We also want to visualise the evolution of the concentration distribution.

```julia
using Plots

# Time loop
for it = 1:nt
  dCdt = ...
  C    = ...
  display(plot(xc, C, lw=2, xlims=(xc[1], xc[end]), ylims=(0.0, 1.0),
               xlabel="Lx", ylabel="Concentration", title="time = $(it*dt)",
               framestyle=:box, label="Concentration"))
end
```

- Make sure to update the arrays `dCdt` and `C` using the [dot syntax](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#man-vectorized) for vectorised functions.

- The `display()` function will force to update the figure within the loop. Note that in Jupyter notebooks, you can use following syntax to avoid the creation of a new figure at each step.

```julia
using IJulia
IJulia.clear_output(true)
display(plot(...))
```

ðŸ‘‰ Your turn. Let's implement the reaction physics.

After the time loop, we can also display the initial concentration we stored `Ci` and the equilibrium concentration `Ceq`:

```julia
plot!(xc, Ci, lw=2, label="C initial")
display(plot!(xc, Ceq*ones(nx), lw=2, label="Ceq"))
```

Note that calling further instances of `plot!()` will act as "hold-on" and allow to display multiple objects on top of each other.

We may want to write a single "monolithic" `reaction_1D.jl` code to perform these steps that looks as following

```julia:ex4
using Plots

@views function reaction_1D()
    # Physics
    Lx   = 10.0
    Î¾    = 10.0
    Ceq  = 0.5
    ttot = 20.0
    # Numerics
    nx   = 128
    # Derived numerics
    dx   = Lx/nx
    dt   = Î¾/2.0
    nt   = cld(ttot, dt)
    xc   = LinRange(dx/2, Lx-dx/2, nx)
    # Array initialisation
    C    =  rand(Float64, nx)
    Ci   =  copy(C)
    dCdt = zeros(Float64, nx)
    # Time loop
    for it = 1:nt
        #dCdt = ...
        #C    = ...
        #display(plot(xc, C, lw=2, xlims=(xc[1], xc[end]), ylims=(0.0, 1.0),
                     #xlabel="Lx", ylabel="Concentration", title="time = $(it*dt)",
                     #framestyle=:box, label="Concentration"))
    end
    #plot!(xc, Ci, lw=2, label="C initial")
    #display(plot!(xc, Ceq*ones(nx), lw=2, label="Ceq"))
    return
end

reaction_1D()
```

So, excellent, we have our first 1D ODE solver up and running in Julia :-)

## PDEs

From reactions to diffusion and advection - involving gradients (neighbouring cells).

Starting from the reaction script that we just finalised, we will now do as few as possible changes to solve the diffusion equation.

The [diffusion equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_equation) was introduced by Fourier in 1822 to understand heat distribution ([heat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation)) in various materials.

Diffusive processes were also employed by Fick in 1855 with application to chemical and particle diffusion ([Fick's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fick%27s_laws_of_diffusion)).

The diffusion equation is often reported as a second order parabolic PDE, here for a multivariable function $C(x,t)$ showing derivatives in both temporal $âˆ‚t$ and spatial $âˆ‚x$ derivatives (or changes)

$$
\frac{âˆ‚C}{âˆ‚t} = D\frac{âˆ‚^2 C}{âˆ‚ x^2}~,
$$

where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.

The second order formulation is only possible if the diffusion coefficient D is a single value valid in all the considered domain.

A more general description allowing for non-uniform, non-linear diffusion coefficient combines a diffusive flux:

$$ q = -D\frac{âˆ‚C}{âˆ‚x}~,$$

and a conservation or flux balance equations:

$$ \frac{âˆ‚C}{âˆ‚t} = -\frac{âˆ‚q}{âˆ‚x}~. $$

To discretise the diffusion equation, we will keep the explicit forward Euler method as temporal discretisation and use [finite-differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference) for the spatial discretisation.

Finite-differences discretisation on regular staggered grid allows for concise and performance oriented algorithms, because only neighbouring cell access is needed to evaluate gradient and data alignment is natively pretty optimal.

A long story short, we will approximate the gradient of concentration $C$ over a distance $âˆ‚x$, a first derivative $\frac{âˆ‚C}{âˆ‚x}$, we will perform following discrete operation

$$ \frac{C_{x+dx} - C_{x}}{dx}~, $$

where $dx$ is the discrete size of the cell.

The same reasoning also applies to the flux balance equation.

We can use Julia's `diff()` operator to apply the $ C_{x+dx} - C_{x} $,
```julia
C[ix+1] - C[ix]
```
in a vectorised fashion to our entire `C` vector as
```julia
diff(C)
```

So, we are ready to solve the 1D diffusion equation.

Starting from the reaction code, turn `Î¾` into `D=1.0`, the diffusion coefficient, remove `C_eq`, set total simulation time `ttot = 2.0`

```julia:ex5
# Physics
Lx   = 10.0
D    = 1.0
ttot = 2.0
```

The only change in the `# Derived numerics` section is the diffusive stable time step definition, to comply with the [CFL stability condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courantâ€“Friedrichsâ€“Lewy_condition) for explicit time integration

```julia:ex6
# Derived numerics
dt   = dx^2/D/2.1
```

In the `# Array initialisation` section, we need a new object to hold the diffusive flux in x direction `qx`

```julia:ex7
dCdt = zeros(Float64, nx) # wring size - will fail because of staggering
qx   = zeros(Float64, nx) # wring size - will fail because of staggering
```

Wait... what about the staggering ?

No surprise `C .= diff(C)` won't work ...

ðŸ‘‰ Your turn. Let's implement our first diffusion solver trying to think about how to solve the staggering issue.

The initialisation steps of the diffusion code should contain

```julia:ex8
# Physics
Lx   = 10.0
D    = 1.0
ttot = 2.0
# Numerics
nx   = 12
nout = 10
# Derived numerics
dx   = Lx/nx
dt   = dx^2/D/2.1
nt   = cld(ttot, dt)
xc   = LinRange(dx/2, Lx-dx/2, nx)
# Array initialisation
C    =  rand(Float64, nx)
Ci   =  copy(C)
dCdt = zeros(Float64, nx-2)
qx   = zeros(Float64, nx-1);
```

_(execute it)_

Followed by the 3 physics computations (lines) in the time loop

```julia:ex9
# Time loop
for it = 1:nt
    qx         .= .-D.*diff(C )./dx
    dCdt       .= .-   diff(qx)./dx
    C[2:end-1] .= C[2:end-1] .+ dt.*dCdt
    # Visualisation
end
```

_(execute it)_

One can examine the size of the various vectors ...

```julia:ex10
# check sizes and staggering
@show size(qx)
@show size(dCdt)
@show size(C)
@show size(C[2:end-1]);
```

... and visualise it

```julia:ex11
using Plots
 plot(xc               , C   , legend=false, linewidth=:1.0, markershape=:circle, markersize=5, framestyle=:box)
plot!(xc[1:end-1].+dx/2, qx  , legend=false, linewidth=:1.0, markershape=:circle, markersize=5, framestyle=:box)
plot!(xc[2:end-1]      , dCdt, legend=false, linewidth=:1.0, markershape=:circle, markersize=5, framestyle=:box)
```

Note: plotting and visualisation is slow. A convenient workaround is to only visualise or render the figure every `nout` iteration within the time loop

```julia
if it % nout == 0
    plot()
end
```

## Advection

From reactions to diffusion and advection - involving gradients (neighbouring cells).
