# 101-0250-00: Solving partial differential equations in parallel on GPUs

ðŸ‘‰ [**Go to course website**](https://pde-on-gpu.vaw.ethz.ch/)

**Welcome to the ETH course 101-0250-00 - Fall 2025 edition!**

This course aims to cover state-of-the-art methods in modern parallel Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) computing, supercomputing and code development with applications to natural sciences and engineering. This course is the first part of a two-part series, focusing on the fundamentals of GPU programming and parallel numerical methods. The second part, offered in the spring semester next year, is project-based: participants will design and implement their own GPU-accelerated applications.

## Homework and Evaluation

All homework assigments can be done alone or in groups of two.

Enrolled ETHZ students will have to hand in on [Moodle](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=26390) and GitHub:

1. Eight weekly assignments during the course's Part 1 and Part 2 constitute 65% of the final grade. **The best seven out of eight homeworks will be counted**.
2. A final project developed during Part 3 of the course consitutes 35% of the final grade.
